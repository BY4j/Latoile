        <p>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon[a] is a 2023 mecha-based vehicular combat game developed by FromSoftware
          and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game serves as a reboot for the franchise, is the first entry
          in the Armored Core series since Armored Core: Verdict Day (2013) and was released for PlayStation 4,
          PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Armored Core VI received generally favorable reviews
          and became the highest-selling entry in the series, selling 1.3 million copies on Windows alone. <br><br>
          The gameplay in Armored Core VI emphasizes mecha-based vehicular combat. Players in this game take on the role
          of expert pilots in control of strong mechs known as Armored Cores. The huge flexibility for modification of
          these mechs with the use of various parts allows players to enhance and sharpen their capabilities.
          The option for players to arm their mechs with a range of weaponry is a standout aspect of the game. One on
          each arm and two on the mech's back are available slots for these weapons. The players' broad arsenals grant
          users strategic freedom as they participate in combat.</p>
